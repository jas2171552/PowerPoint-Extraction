I did not write this script.  I altered the script found here: https://gist.github.com/tiwo/f3900653855132c8d26377394a9c29b4 to meet my needs

Set output file variable to where you want the JPG or PNG files saves
Set the output format:  
   num_exported = ExportSlides(arg, "JPG", 3) for JPEG 
   or 
   num_exported = ExportSlides(arg, "PNG", 3) for PNG

To unpack the PPT , drag the PPT file on top of the VB scrip.  It will automatically execute and save the slides.  There will be a notification


export a Powerpoint presentation to JPEG images, one per slide. Used as a workaround to the broken JPEG export in Powerpoint itself, which yields only low quality images.


Usage
You can adjust the image resolution by varying the numerical argument in line 46, in the call to ExportSlides.

Just drag and drop one or more PPT or PPTX files onto the vbs script. The script will process each, showing a short message, and create Image files named like example.pptx-0001.jpg.

From the command line, call cscript ppt2jpeg.vbs [example.pptx] [next.pptx] ....
