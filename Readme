Disclaimer: I did not write this script.  I altered the script found here: https://gist.github.com/tiwo/f3900653855132c8d26377394a9c29b4 to meet my needs

Purpose:  This VBS, when executed, will take a user specified PowerPoint (.pptx) and copy each slide individually to a destination 
folder as directed as either a .PNG or .JPG format.

Use: double click the executable file.  It will ask for a filepath and file name of the PowerPoint (no need to add the extension).  It will
also ask the user to enter  1 for PNG or 2 for JPEG output.  A selection other than this will default to PNG.  If the file does not exist
and message box will be displayyed saying as much.
